Purpose

My website serves as a dynamic platform to showcase the skills I’ve developed through my internships and personal projects, with a strong focus on cloud architecture, software development, and networking. It also represents a reimagined and enhanced version of the Apollo project I worked on during my Summer 2023 internship at AWS. By leveraging AWS technologies, I’ve built a scalable, cloud-hosted application that highlights my ability to design and implement end-to-end solutions. Beyond technical projects, the website provides a comprehensive look at my resume, offering insights into my experience, education, and technical proficiencies. It’s a space where I can present my work, reflect on my growth, and demonstrate how my skills come together to create impactful solutions—whether in cloud computing, software development, or networking. Take a look around and enjoy!


Project Overview

To further demonstrate my technical abilities, I built a personal portfolio website using a similar architecture to my Apollo project. The goal was to showcase my ability to integrate AWS services while delivering a fully functional, cloud-hosted web application. This project highlights my proficiency in cloud storage, API interactions, front-end development, and domain management.


Technical Implementation

The website’s architecture is built on a serverless framework, utilizing Amazon S3 for hosting static assets and storing images. Portfolio details, including metadata and references to these images, are stored in Amazon DynamoDB, a NoSQL database optimized for scalability and low-latency data retrieval. Data interactions are managed through AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs, with custom-designed schemas and resolvers to ensure efficient querying and modification. The front-end, developed using React, features individually coded tabs and dropdown menus to create an intuitive and interactive user experience. To ensure global accessibility and performance, the website is distributed via Amazon CloudFront, with a custom domain secured by an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) SSL certificate. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate multiple AWS services to deliver a scalable, secure, and user-friendly web application.
